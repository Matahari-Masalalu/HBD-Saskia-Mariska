Data Cleaning
Steps for Cleaning the Data
Removing Duplicates: Eliminate any duplicate rows that may skew analysis.
Removing Missing Values (NaN): Address any missing values to ensure data integrity.
Handling Outliers: Use the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to identify and manage outliers that could affect the results.
Univariate Analysis
Overview
Univariate analysis involves examining individual variables to summarize and find patterns within them. This will be the next step in our analysis.

Data Preparation
Encoding Categorical Variables
To prepare the data for modeling, we need to convert categorical variables into a numerical format. This process is essential for machine learning algorithms, which typically require numerical input.

from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# List of categorical features
categorical_features = ['Parental_Involvement', 'Access_to_Resources', 'Extracurricular_Activities', 
                        'Motivation_Level', 'Internet_Access', 'Family_Income', 
                        'Teacher_Quality', 'School_Type', 'Peer_Influence', 
                        'Learning_Disabilities', 'Parental_Education_Level', 
                        'Distance_from_Home', 'Gender']

# Initialize a dictionary to hold label encoders for each categorical feature
label_encoders = {}
for column in categorical_features:
    le = LabelEncoder()
    StudentPerformanceFactors[column] = le.fit_transform(StudentPerformanceFactors[column])
    label_encoders[column] = le
Splitting the Dataset
Next, we will split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the models, while the testing set will be used to evaluate their performance.

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.1, random_state=123)

print(f'Total # of samples in the whole dataset: {len(X)}')
print(f'Total # of samples in the training dataset: {len(X_train)}')
print(f'Total # of samples in the testing dataset: {len(X_test)}')
Feature Scaling
Standardizing the features is crucial for algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the data.

Interpretation of Results
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): This model may provide a good baseline performance, but can be sensitive to outliers and the choice of k.
Random Forest Regressor: Generally, this model tends to perform well due to its ensemble nature, capturing complex relationships in the data.
Boosting (AdaBoost): This model can enhance performance by combining weak learners, often resulting in lower error rates.
Conclusion
The results indicate that different models have varying degrees of effectiveness in predicting exam scores based on the provided features. The Random Forest and Boosting models typically outperform the KNN model, suggesting their ability to capture non-linear relationships in the data.

Next Steps
Feature Importance Analysis: Investigate which features contribute most significantly to the predictions.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model performance through hyperparameter tuning using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search.
Deployment: Consider deploying the best-performing model for real-time predictions and insights.
